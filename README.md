# Public GitHub Pages Pack Studio

## Overview
This single-page application (SPA) provides a client-side, self-contained pack generator designed for GitHub Pages. It exports a curated set of content files (text, JSON, SVG, and license) so you can publish a public site that explains and hosts these resources without relying on a server.

## Features
- Bootstrap 5 UI for a clean, professional look
- Client-side generation of several required files (ashravan.txt, dilemma.json, about.md, pelican.svg, restaurant.json, prediction.json, uid.txt, LICENSE, and a generated index.html)
- Preview and download per file
- Complete error handling with user-friendly messages
- Lightweight and production-ready structure

## Setup
- No local build steps required. This SPA runs entirely in the browser.
- Host the provided index.html, style.css, and script.js on any static host (e.g., GitHub Pages).

## Usage
1. Open index.html in your browser.
2. Click "Export All Content Files" to generate and download all required assets as downloadable files.
3. Optionally click "Preview" on any card to view the file content before exporting.
4. Use the included LICENSE (MIT) for licensing on your project.
